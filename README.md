# message-app

  Intro: who am I and my path to aca
  Problem I decided to tackle with this project (inspiration)
  Showoff the project itself (chalenges overcome)
  conclusion, where will it go



  This application is a test for a full stack application using react.js, next.js
 and next redux wrapper. The state and store will be managed on the pages
 rendered (located in the pages directory no less!)

 The back end:
  I developer the back end first on my projects, and test it with postman before
 starting on at front end UI work. This project will use express and mongoDB.
 Hosted locally for now.

 Styling:
  I tested glamor and glamorous for the styling. Style pages will contain
 styling objects with key value pairs using glamor. Then with glamorous, I
 turn those objects into components, assigning the component the
 html tag needed. If the stylesheet has more than one glamorous component, I
 wrap those components into an object, export the object, and import the whole
 object onto the page needed. Using dot notation, assign the desired style to the
 html tag on the page. (example: <syles.basic>)

 Authentication:
   Authentication is coming for this application. The backend auth routes are running.

Future Developments for Message-App:
  <> Finish authentication front end

  <> Display user credentials on the message page both in the text input field and
     the text container.

  <> Allow users to input other forms of media into the field, such as pictures

  <> Developer more personal profile pages for users, and allow this data to be
     reachable from the message page.

  <> Host the application with heroku, ....profit?
